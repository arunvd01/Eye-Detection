# 🧠 Computer Vision & Camera Access Utilities

This repository contains Python-based Jupyter notebooks focusing on real-time **Computer Vision** tasks and **camera integration** using OpenCV and other vision-related libraries.

## 📁 Contents

- **`CV.ipynb`**:  
  A notebook implementing various computer vision techniques such as image processing, object detection, contour analysis, etc.

- **`CamAccess.ipynb`**:  
  Demonstrates how to access and stream video from your webcam using Python and OpenCV, including frame capture and display.

## 🚀 Features

- Access live webcam feed using OpenCV
- Apply real-time filters and processing to video frames
- Perform basic object detection and image manipulation
- Modular, easy-to-understand Jupyter notebooks for quick prototyping

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

Let me know if you’d like me to:
- Add a `requirements.txt`
- Convert this to a `README.md` file
- Include more technical details from the actual notebooks

Would you like me to read and summarize specific sections from the notebooks to make the README even# Eye-Detection
